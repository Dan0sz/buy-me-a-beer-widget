# Buy me a Beer?
## A Donation form widget for WordPress

This is the source code for the widget I use on [my blog](https://daan.dev). 

It's a PayPal donation form, which you can use if you have a PayPal account to ask people to support you in your work.

It's kind of a spin-off of 'Buy me a Coffee', which you see on some blogs. I just thought that 'a beer' sounded cooler.

The widget offers many configurable options, which allow you to modify all the contents of the form:

- Add your own Hosted Button ID (you can find this when you generate a button in your PayPal account),
- Change the Title of the Widget,
- Add Titles and Descriptions to the Form fields,
- Change the value of the Donate-button,
- Add a Thank you-message.

I'm not offering any support on this widget, so all configuration and further customization is up to you.

Enjoy!
